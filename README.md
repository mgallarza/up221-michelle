## About Me
Hi, my name is Michelle Gallarza and I'm a second year MURP student concentrating in EAP (with a bit of CEDH mixed in). Being from a working class Latinx neighborhood in LA, I'm eager to use my planning education to serve communities like my own and give back to the city that raised me. When I'm not studying or working, I enjoy going to concerts, trying new vegan restaurants, working out, and chilling with my puppy.

## Project Ideas
I'd like to examine extreme heat and heat waves in Los Angeles alongside factors such as pollution burden, air quality, hospitalization rates, income levels, transit access, and tree canopy, particularly as they relate to the location and utilization of community resilience centers.

## Class Objectives
As a complete beginner, I would like to gain a firm grasp on how to use Python, GIS, and spatial analysis to examine and address complex urban issues.
